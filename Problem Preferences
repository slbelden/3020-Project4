Honestly I know so little about most of these problems that any of them could be very bad or very easy.
1-4 are all pretty much interchangable for my preferences.

Preference 1: Weiss 10.55 p 524 - Longest common subsequence
	Similar to a problem he did in class. Looks solveable.

Preference 2: Weiss 10.56 p 524 - Approximate pattern matching
	Sounds cool, but challeninging. Matching strings with errors.

Preference 3: Weiss 10.62 p 525 - Largest submatrix of ones
	Matrix problem. Not sure how to solve it, but the premise looks simple.

Preference 4: Dasgupta 6.7 p 179 - Palindromic subsequence 
	String problem. Looks ok.

Preference 5: Dasgupta 8.7 p 265 - 3SAT
	Reduction of a NP-Complete problem; looks like Boolean logic and saatisfiability problems.
	Lots of stuff to learn from scratch and lots of math.
	
Preference 6: Weiss 10.48 p 522 - Minimum spanning tree, apply to Hamiltonian diagonal
	Solution of a traveling salesman problem. Do not want.

Preference 7: Weiss 10.37 p 521 - Skip lists, apply to Hamiltonian diagonal
	No clue what a skip list is. Looks very complicated. No idea what a Hamiltonian diagonal is,
	and all the Google searches for it point to articles about quantum mechanics.
